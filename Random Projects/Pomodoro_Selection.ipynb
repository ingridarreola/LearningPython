    "Decision fatigue is “the idea that after making many decisions, your ability to make more and more decisions over the course of a day becomes worse. By the time the average person goes to bed, they’ve made over 35,000 decisions and all of those decisions take time and energy, and certainly can deplete us.”  Dr. MacLean\n",

The issue I run into is that I get decision fatigue and don't know where to start amidst the multiple goals I have throughout a week. I'd like some help in this area, by removing the decisions and having them chosen at random. \n",
