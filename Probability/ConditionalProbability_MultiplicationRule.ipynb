    "# Conditional Probability\n",
    "If we want to calculate the probability that a pair of dependent events both occur, we need to define conditional probability. Using a bag of marbles as an example, let’s remind ourselves of the definition of dependent events:\n",
    "\n",
    "![marbles](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/skillpaths/master-stats-ii/intro-probability/marble-diagram-1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we pick two marbles from a bag of five marbles without replacement, the probability that the second marble is red depends on the color of the first marble. We have a special name for this: conditional probability. In short, conditional probability measures the probability of one event occurring, given that another one has already occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notationally, we denote the word “given” with a vertical line. For example, if we want to represent the probability that we choose a red marble given the first marble is blue, we can write:\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(Red Second∣Blue First)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above diagram, we know that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(Red Second∣Blue First)= 3/4 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we picked out two marbles with replacement? What does the conditional probability look like? Well, let’s think about this. Regardless of which marble we pick out first, it will be put back into the bag. Therefore, the probability of picking out a red marble or a blue marble second is unaffected by the first outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for independent events, we can say the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(A∣B)=P(A)\n",
    "and\n",
    "P(B∣A)=P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "```"

    "# Multiplication Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "We have looked at the addition rule, which describes the probability one event OR another event (or both) occurs. What if we want to calculate the probability that two events happen simultaneously? For two events, A and B, this is P(A and B) or the probability of the intersection of A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula for the probability that two events occur simultaneously is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(A and B) = P(A) ⋅ P(B∣A)\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, for independent events, we can simplify this formula slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependent Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go back to our bag of marbles example. We have five marbles: two are blue, and three are red. We pick two marbles without replacement. What if we want to know the probability of choosing a blue marble first AND a blue marble second?\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking conditional probability into account, the multiplication rule for these two dependent events is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(Blue 1st and Blue 2nd) = P(Blue 1st) ⋅ P(Blue 2nd ∣ Blue 1st)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Blue 1st and Blue 2nd) = 2/5 ⋅ 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Blue 1st and Blue 2nd) = 1/10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one potential outcome when picking two marbles out of the bag. One way to visualize all possible outcomes of a pair of events is a *tree diagram*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree diagrams have the following properties:\n",
    "- Each branch represents a specific set of events.\n",
    "- The probabilities the terminal branches (all possible sets of outcomes) sum to one.\n",
    "- We multiply across branches (using the multiplication rule!) to calculate the probability that each branch (set of outcomes) will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Independent Events\n",
    "\n",
    "For two independent events, the multiplication rule becomes less complicated. The probability of two independent events occurring is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(A and B) = P(A) ⋅ P(B)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the following is true for independent events:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(B∣A) = P(B)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the simplest example: flipping a fair coin twice. Event A is that we get tails on the first flip, and event B is that we get tails on the second flip. `P(A) = P(B) = 0.5`, so according to our formula, the probability of getting tails on both flips would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "P(A and B) = 0.5 ⋅ 0.5 =0.25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually on a tree diagram, we see:\n",
