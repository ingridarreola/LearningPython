# Intro to Classes ---> Python Classes: Medical Insurance Project

### Objective: You have been asked to develop a system that makes it easier to organize patient data. You will create a class that does the following: 
# - Takes in patient parameters regarding their personal information
# - Contains methods that allow users to update their information
# - Gives patients insight into their potential medical fees.

## [Step 0]
####### If you look at script.py, you will see that we have started a class called Patient. It currently has an __init__ method with two class variables: self.name and self.age. Let’s start by adding in some more patient parameters:
### - sex: patient’s biological identification, 0 for male and 1 for female
### - bmi: patient BMI
### - num_of_children: number of children patient has
### - smoker: patient smoking status, 0 for a non-smoker and 1 for a smoker
# Add these into the __init__ method so that we can use them as we create our class methods.
