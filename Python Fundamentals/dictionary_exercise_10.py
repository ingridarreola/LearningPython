# Dictionary Exercise ---> Using Dictionaries --> Delete a Key

#### LESSON  
# .pop() works to delete items from a dictionary, when you know the key value.

###  [Step 0]
# we start with a dictionary
available_items = {"health potion": 10, "cake of the cure": 5, "green elixir": 20, "strength sandwich": 25, "stamina grains": 15, "power stew": 30}
health_points = 20

###  [Step 1]
# You are designing the video game Big Rock Adventure. We have provided a dictionary of items that are in the playerâ€™s inventory which add points to their health meter. In one line, add the corresponding value of the key "stamina grains" to the health_points variable and remove the item "stamina grains" from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, add 0 to health_points.

health_points += available_items.pop("stamina grains", 0)

###  [Step 2]
# In one line, add the value of "power stew" to health_points and remove the item from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, add 0 to health_points.

health_points += available_items.pop("power stew", 0)


###  [Step 3]
# In one line, add the value of "mystic bread" to health_points and remove the item from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, add 0 to health_points.

health_points += available_items.pop("mystic bread", 0)


###  [Step 4]
# Print available_items and health_points.
print(available_items)
print(health_points)

# prints out --->
# {'health potion': 10, 'cake of the cure': 5, 'green elixir': 20, 'strength sandwich': 25}
