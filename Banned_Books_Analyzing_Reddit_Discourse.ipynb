    "# Banned Books: analyzing Reddit discourse on the rise of book banning from 2020 to the present in the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "How do inhabitants in the United States feel about the rise in books being banned in schools, libraries, and universities on Reddit? How has this evolved from 2020 until present day? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Books are being banned from schools and public libraries at high rates, and organizations such as the American Library Association (ALA) document and track the number of attempts to censor books, materials, and services across schools libraries. The ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom has collected this data for the past 20 years and has found a sharp rise in attempts to censor books; the number of unique book titles challenged in the U.S. was 223 in 2020, it escalated to 1,858 in 2021, and rose to 2,571 in 2022 (American Library Association, 2023).[^1] This increase in censorship has caused fighting among communities which is amplified by social media and politics. Campaigns are formed to censor subjects such as LGBTQ rights, gender studies, and racial inequality. In fact, among the unique book titles challenged in 2021, the majority of these topics centered on LGBTQ people or on people of color. Partisan groups are organizing to remove books that don't agree with a political agenda. There have also been increases in proposed legislation to place restrictions on libraries (Alter, A., Harris, E., 2023).[^2] \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "For this study, Reddit is the social media platform that will be used to retrieve data. There are a few subreddits that can be used including: r/education, r/books, r/libraries, r/booksuggestions, r/news, r/literature, r/FreeSpeech, r/politics. I will be using the Reddit API to access the data. The posts will be collected among the subreddits which have posts relating to book bans in schools, libraries, and universities. The amount of bans is highest for schools and libraries, while a minimal amount happen in universities and the amount of posts will try to match this distribution as well. At least 500 data points will be collected pertaining to posts on book bans in schools, libraries, and universities. The data will also focus on January 2020 until present day since the amount of bans has risen dramatically beginning in 2021, allowing for me to see what might have been before the rise in bans, the initial rise, and present day when the number is at an all time high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "The Reddit API will be used to search through the subreddits, and possibly expand to include more than the initial list noted so that at least 500 data points are collected. This will include post titles, post content, comments, number of comments, number of upvotes, the timestamp of each post, and its associated subreddit name. \n",

I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful; I simply wanted to know why the adults I trusted believed what they did. I still couldn’t understand why my community tried so hard to keep out people with diverse backgrounds, or how my pastor could be so absolutely certain that his theology was the absolute truth. I wanted to hear everyone’s reasoning, and then decide for myself what I believed.  \n",

I still remember when a pastor from my church met with my parents to express concern about my ‘walk with Jesus,’ because of the questions I had been asking. I was shocked by his reaction.

I set it on Sunday, and was pleased to have books borrowed from it but also patrons browsing the list.\n",

We also do a reading party where anyone can sign up to read from or discuss a banned book. A couple years ago I worked on getting us more banned books programming but it didn't pan out since I left the college for a semester and came back in a different position, just got back to the library this year and have shifted focus to other things. Still hoping to get more recent challenged books read tomorrow. We haven't put a lot of focus on current challenges due to Transphobia/homophobia.\n",

First of all, I was aghast and uncomfortable. I knew I wasn't supposed to be reading it, and I finally understood *why* I wasn't supposed to be reading it.

Saying you want to then go back and remove a book... that's when it becomes forbidden knowledge, and that's when you become the bad guy in the story. You're the bad guy because you believe that there is specific knowledge that other people (kids or not) shouldn't have, and that is always wrong.\n",

These are the books the community wanted. There are conservative books that get reviews, but they are moderate conservative books. Not extreme conservative books. Naturally, my coworkers all got other jobs. We dropped like flies.

Public Libraries, at least in my state, are mandated by state law to serve every resident in their service area. There are no exceptions to that. A city council person telling us not to serve LGBTQ individuals and families or anyone else is telling us to break the law . Trying to enforce perspective bias in public libraries, while popular in some circles, is the same as telling us to not serve the people who don't agree the party approved thoughts. It will also undermine more than just the library, it will erode civic participation across the board.

      "\n",
      "There's benefits to banning certain cultural products. There's also costs. The \"de facto\" solution to this dilemma is to not ban any cultural products. Since there's not a lot of consensus associated with how to navigate the problem and find some kind of middle ground, the defacto solution is usually employed. Some believe this is a good thing, others believe it's not so great. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Additionally, there's some areas where it can be demonstrated empirically that we're not banning enough cultural products e.g. pornography, etc. However, even in these areas where the cold hard data exists, it's very hard to get a strong enough consensus that creating meaningful legislation is politically viable. In areas where the cold hard data doesn't exist, it's even harder to get any kind of consensus. In practice then, not many cultural products are outright banned. Note that this has some benefits. In particular, true and correct viewpoints that are nevertheless offensive to a sizeable subset of the population can nevertheless be disseminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, note that once upon a time, responsibility largely rested on library owners and administrators for ensuring their libraries were filled with lots of \"good\" books and not too many \"bad\" books. Of course, the church wielded its power through the legislature, so power wasn't solely in the hands of librarians and library owners. In any event, the system worked to an extent, though of course the political and religious biases of those authorities was actualized in the books they ended up housing. These comments mainly matter for historical reasons, since the Internet allows us to bypass such authorities nowadays. Nevertheless, the same basic dynamics apply to any repository of knowledge (or ignorance, as the case may be) on the Internet. So, whereas once upon a time we had a small number of libraries trying their best to decide what books to have copies of and what books not to have copies of, we now have a diffuse network of websites, and the administrators, owners and users of these websites spend a lot of time deciding what to link to and what not to link to.\n",
      "\n",
      "In regards to political actors, since impingements on freedom of speech are oftentimes quite dangerous, the best solution would probably involve some kind of direct democratic voting that removes political actors from the picture as much as practicable. Also, the voting should be subject to fairly libertarian cutoffs, so that it's quite hard to get cultural products banned in general. Note that, although the libertarian position \"the banning of any cultural products is fundamentally bad for our society\" is objectively untrue relative to pretty much any theory of morality you can think of, there's obviously enormous risks associated with most kinds of censorship, so it pays to tread carefully.\n",

Of course, as you probably know, for all of those there is long-standing debate as well as tons of court cases pushing at the definitions and limits, mostly trending in the direction of allowing publication. One of the more famous instances would be the [Pentagon Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers#The_Nixon_administration's_restraint_of_the_media), where the Supreme Court permitted publication reporting of leaked classified material and ruled against \"prior restraint\" by the U.S. government, a case that continues to echo through situations like Wikileaks and Edward Snowden.\n",

It used to be that a principle in American thought about free expression was viewpoint neutrality by the government — that government officials would as much as possible refrain from privileging certain viewpoints that were matters of public debate and disfavoring others, in effect putting their fingers on the scales of the \"marketplace of ideas.\" But like so many things, that America is long gone.\n",

Book banning is when a book is censored or banned by government institutions, such as removing from the public library or public schools. Lately, [local governments in the US are pressuring businesses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/07/26/texas-book-ban-law-challenged/) to censor books, which would also be included in the umbrella term for this sub.

In the US, it's no longer legal to say \"Hey, you can't vote if you're this color/if you can't answer these obscure civics questions/if you can't afford this tax,\" so those who hold power--particularly in certain states--have moved on to using less direct strategies.  This makes it more *difficult* for those of us in certain groups to vote, but it doesn't *actually* take away our right to, so that's A-OK.  And it produces the desired electoral outcomes, at least most of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "For book banning, the equivalent strategy isn't to hunt down and destroy every copy of these books, or to throw people in jail for reading them.  It's to put social pressure on them for stepping out of line; in particular, for showing curiosity about how the world works, or for empathizing with the bogeyman of the day (gays, minorities, foreigners, etc etc).  Get them in the habit of keeping their heads down and avoiding that pressure--the younger the better--and they'll have trouble getting out of that habit later in life.
